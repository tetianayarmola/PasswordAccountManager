Project title: Single Page Application - Password Manager

Project Background:

Digital security issue raised dramatically nowadays. And managing passwords has become an everyday challenge, especially for non-technical users. It leads to weak passwords, its reuse, poor encryption and data breaches. Many people, such as my parents, find existing password management software too complex and difficult to pick up. This projectâ€™s aim is to address these issues by offering a simple, user-friendly solution to keep passwords, maybe not in the safest place it could be, but in a lot more efficient way than on a piece of paper.
