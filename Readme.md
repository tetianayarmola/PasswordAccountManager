Project Background:

Digital security issue raised dramatically nowadays. And managing passwords has become an everyday challenge, especially for non-technical users.

This projectâ€™s aim is to address these issues by offering a simple, user-friendly solution to keep passwords, maybe not in the safest place it could be, but in a lot more efficient way than on a piece of paper.
